# Argos Crea

Argos Crea is a web-based application designed to facilitate speech-to-text (STT) tasks, particularly for forestry applications. The software leverages the Italian Forestry Speech Commands dataset, which is specifically curated and used to train the STT engine.

- **JavaScript**  
  Used alongside TypeScript for compatibility and certain dynamic functionalities.
